``ar.describe()``
=================

Welcome to my small corner of the web! Career-wise, I'm a Data Scientist at `Performance Phenomics`_ (PP). In a nutshell, at PP we collect various types of MRI scans of peoples brains, and using that information gathered from those scans, some domain-specific knowledge, and a little ML, we try to model neurological function/potential/health, with the aim of being able to provide insight regarding a persons "cognitive potential", capacity to recover following injury, as well as other neurological characteristics.

For PP I do all sorts of things. Contribute to and maintain the code-base. Code predominantly in Python. Create data visualizations. Sythesize the domain knowledge brought to the table from our neuro-experts together with my own knowledge in mathematics and data science. Learn as much as I can about software engineering best-practices, cloud architecture, and data modeling. Learn as much as I can about everything else. And most importantly, find any way that I can to use my expertise to push the company forward.

As of this writing (20191130) this site serves as a slightly extended "about me", as well as a place (other than `LinkedIn`_) to find my resume. There are handful of things that might also appear here in the near(-ish) future, but to avoid making promises I'm not sure that I can keep - let's just say that this site is another copy of my resume.


``ar.professional_summary()``
-----------------------------

Voracious learner, cloud dweller, ML practitioner, pythonista, and all around data guy. Passion for building innovative solutions with new tools, working with motivated people to discover new ideas, and if we can find a way to slide some interesting math in there I'm even happier.


``ar.professional_summary(short=False)``
----------------------------------------

I am someone with an insatiable hunger for knowledge, a resourceful problem solver, an engaging communicator, and have a passion for mastering new skills.

My training as a mathematician enables me to work efficiently, distill very complex problems down to their core concepts, and find innovative ways of solving these problems. (And to boldly go where no man has gone before!)

I'm excited by the rapid advancements in machine learning and data science as a whole. My fascination with this field drives me to tackle new challenges, wrangle (bigger and bigger) data sets to gain interesting insights about the real world, and implement the latest algorithms.

So whether it's training myself, a neural network or my girlfriend's dog, I'm always trying to reach my goals and learn new skills through new experiences. When I'm not neck-deep in machine learning papers I enjoy tossing some disc (enjoy is maybe an understatement) and Iâ€™m also a woodworking enthusiast! I find it very fulfilling building something with my hands.
